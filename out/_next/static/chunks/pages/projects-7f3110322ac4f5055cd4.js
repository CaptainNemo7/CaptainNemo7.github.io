This would expand into different style games such as free for all or team based and could expand to games being dropped anywhere all over the world. It would be fun to host competitions to pit cities against each other.

It makes it easy for weight lifting to know what your workout for the day is and to pull from your past workouts. It helps to know how much weight you d id last time for this workout and where to start at. Eventually I would like to add a section called the kitchen for food tracking and sharing and also for Focus to be able to generate workouts specifically for you based off your goals and past injuries.
