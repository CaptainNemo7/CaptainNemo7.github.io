It is built with Swift, UIKit, and uses firebase for the back end. It allows users to track, build, and share workouts. Users can post pictures/videos for their followers and take workouts others have posted. It makes it easy for weight lifting to know what your workout for the day is and to pull from your past workouts. It helps to know how much weight you d id last time for this workout and where to start at. Eventually I would like to add a section called the kitchen for food tracking and sharing and also for Focus to be able to generate workouts specifically for you based off your goals and past injuries. Monetization can be added into having trainers or teams pay for accounts and the ability to create team workouts/track their clients and athletes.
